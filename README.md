# BST implementation of ST in Rust 🦀
___⚠️ This is a work in progress.___

## About
This is an implentation of Symbol Table using Binary search trees in rust.

## Status 
Any of the order based methods are not implemented. Also delete is not implemented.
- `size()` ✅
- `put(key, value)` ✅
- `get(key)` ✅
- `min()` ✅
- `max()` ✅
- `ceiling(key)` ✅
- `floor(key)` ✅
- `rank(key)` 🚧
- `select(key)` 🚧
- `delete(key)` 🚧
- Iterators 🚧


## Credit
Many ideas are taken from the original implmentation in Java taken from the book [__Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne__](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/BST.java.html).
